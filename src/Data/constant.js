Custom software is developed specifically for a particular organization or business, taking into account the unique needs, requirements and constraints of that organization. Custom software is designed and built from scratch, by a team of developers, to meet the specific needs of the organization that is commissioning it. Ready-to-use software, on the other hand, is a pre-built software solution that is available for purchase or subscription, and it is intended to be used by a wide range of organizations or individuals. These software are built to meet the general needs of multiple organizations or individuals and not tailored to specific needs. They are easy to use and can be quickly implemented.",
